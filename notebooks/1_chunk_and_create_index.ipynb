    "Foundation models are usually trained offline, making the model agnostic to any data that is created after the model was trained. Additionally, foundation models are trained on very general domain corpora, making them less effective for domain-specific tasks. We can build RAG workflow to retrieve data from outside a foundation model and augment your prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in contxet.  With RAG, the external data used to augment your prompts can come from multiple data sources, such as document repositories, databases or APIs. \n",

It is not intended to be relied upon as a \\ncomprehensive or deﬁnitive guide on each agency’s \\npolicies and practices. The data security measures \\nimplemented by each agency will differ depending on \\nvarious factors such as the sensitivity of the data and \\nthe agency’s assessment of data security risks. The \\nGovernment may update the policies set out in this \\ndocument without publishing such updates to the \\npublic.    \\nThe Government takes its responsibility as a \\ncustodian of data very seriously.\\nSince 2001, the Government’s data security policies have been set out in the Government \\nInstruction Manual (IM) on Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT&SS) Management. In \\n2019, the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee recommended additional technical and \\nprocess measures to protect data and prevent data compromise. The recommended measures \\nhave since been incorporated into the IM on ICT&SS Management.\\nThis document sets out the key policies in the IM on ICT&SS Management that govern how data \\nsecurity is managed by agencies. The policies prescribe data security requirements, including \\ntechnical and process measures, to safeguard data against security threats.\\u2028\\nThe technical and process measures described in this document are implemented using a risk-\\nbased approach. Agencies should select the measures based on the data security risk level, after \\ntaking into account their operating contexts. For example, the recommended measure “Hashing-\\nwith-Salt” irreversibly changes a data ﬁeld in order to prevent an attacker from accessing the \\noriginal value of the data ﬁeld even when the data is extracted from the system. It would be \\nsuitable for use in analytics systems where only de-identiﬁed data is required but not appropriate \\nfor use in operational systems which require identiﬁable data for service delivery.\\n\\u2028\\nNote: This document contains general information for the public only. It is not intended to be relied \\nupon as a comprehensive or deﬁnitive guide on each agency’s policies and practices. The data \\nsecurity measures implemented by each agency will differ depending on various factors such as \\nthe sensitivity of the data and the agency’s assessment of data security risks. The Government \\nmay update the policies set out in this document without publishing such updates to the public.    \\nGovernment Data Security Policies  |   �2\\nSection 1: Data Security Risk Management\\n01\\nTo ensure adequate and eﬀective data security risk management, Agencies should \\nperform data security risk assessments for their datasets, as part of the Government ICT \\nRisk Management Methodology. \\u2028\\nThis will enable Agencies to identify data security risks, evaluate the risks, implement \\nmeasures to mitigate the risks, assess the eﬀectiveness of the implemented measures \\nand manage the risks within limits acceptable to the Agency.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\n02\\nAgencies should use the Data Security Risk Assessment Methodology, which is part of \\nthe Government ICT Risk Management Methodology, to conduct data security risk \\nassessments for their datasets.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\n03\\nAgencies should conduct a data security risk assessment:\\u2028\\na)\\nWhen acquiring a new dataset; \\u2028\\nb)\\nDeveloping a new ICT system that contains personal or entity data; or\\u2028\\nc)\\nWhen existing data which has not been risk assessed is ﬁrst used.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\n04\\nAgencies should review the data security risk assessments:\\u2028\\na)\\nAccording to the frequency stated in the Government Risk Management Policy; or\\u2028\\nb)\\nWhen there are changes to the data security risk factors.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\nGovernment Data Security Policies  |   �3\\nSection 2: Technical and process measures \\nto protect data and prevent data \\ncompromises\\u2028\\n05\\nAgencies should implement the appropriate technical and process measures to protect \\ndata against data security threats and prevent compromises of the conﬁdentiality and \\nintegrity of the data. \\u2028\\nAgencies should adopt a risk-based approach when implementing the technical and \\nprocess measures. Technical measures are only eﬀective when the complementary \\nprocess measures are implemented too (See Annex A).\\n\\u2028\\nThe data security technical and process measures are to be implemented on top of any \\ncybersecurity measures in place.\\n\\u2028\\nData should be protected according to the risk level determined through a data security \\nrisk assessment. Agencies should ensure that data is adequately protected while \\nminimising the impact to operations, resources and costs.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\n06\\nAgencies should adopt the following strategies when implementing the technical \\nmeasures and process measures to safeguard data:\\u2028\\na)\\nReduce the surface area of attack by minimising data collection, data retention, \\ndata access and data downloads;\\u2028\\nb)\\nEnhance the logging and monitoring of data transactions to detect risky or \\nsuspicious activity; and\\u2028\\nc)\\nProtect data in a manner that will render the data unusable even if extracted. \\u2028\\n\\u2028\\nGovernment Data Security Policies  |   �4\\nSection 3: Reduce the surface area of attack \\nby minimising data collection, data retention, \\ndata access and data downloads\\u2028\\nSection 3.1: Collect, retain, and store data where necessary\\u2028\\nCollect datasets only where necessary \\nLimit retention period of data \\n07\\nAgencies should minimise the surface area of attack, i.e. the diﬀerent points through \\nwhich a threat actor can compromise data security, by using the following 3 approaches:\\u2028\\na)\\nCollect, retain, and store data only where necessary;\\u2028\\nb)\\nMinimise the download of data to endpoint devices; and\\u2028\\nc)\\nAccess and use data only for the task at hand.\\u2028\\n\\u2028\\n08\\nAgencies should minimise the collection of datasets to only what is necessary for their \\nfunctions and operations. For each collected dataset, Agencies should identify the \\nspeciﬁc use of the dataset, and whether the dataset is required to carry out an immediate \\nfunction or a pre-requisite to carry out a future function (e.g. longitudinal datasets for \\nanalytics purposes) or both.

The Personal Data Protection Act \\n(“PDPA”) applies to the private sector.  \\n \\nThe need for two different legal frameworks governing data management in the public and \\nprivate sectors arises because the public has different expectations of the services \\nprovided by the Government and the private sector. The public expects the Government to \\ndeliver services in an integrated manner across agencies. In contrast, each private sector \\norganisation is expected to be individually accountable for the personal data in its \\npossession, and there is no expectation of a similarly integrated delivery of services \\nacross different private sector organisations. \\nThe Government takes its \\nresponsibility as a custodian  \\nof data very seriously.\\n Government Personal Data Protection Policies   |   3\\nSince 2001, the Government\\'s data security policies have been set out in the IM on ICT&SS \\nManagement. The IM on ICT&SS Management sets out how the Government manages and \\nprotects data (including personal data) in its possession or control. In 2018, the PSGA was \\nenacted to further strengthen public sector data governance. The PSGA imposes criminal \\npenalties on public oﬃcers who (a) knowingly or recklessly disclose data without \\nauthorisation; (b) misuse data that results in personal gain for the public oﬃcer or another \\nperson, or harm or loss to another person; and (c) knowingly or recklessly re-identify \\nanonymised information without authorisation. \\nThis document sets out the key policies in the IM on ICT&SS Management that govern how \\npersonal data is managed and protected by agencies. \\nThese policies apply to all personal data (in electronic (structured and unstructured) and \\nnon-electronic forms) possessed, controlled, or processed by an agency, except: \\n(a)\\nPersonal data of a deceased individual (However, provisions relating to the disclosure \\nof personal data and protection of personal data shall apply in respect of the \\npersonal data of an individual who has been dead for 10 or less years.);

       " 'Key Policies of the\\nGovernment’s Third-Party\\nManagement Framework\\nNote: This document contains general information for \\nthe public only. It is not intended to be relied upon as \\na comprehensive or deﬁnitive guide on each \\nagency’s policies and practices. The Government \\nmay, in its sole discretion, update the policies set out in \\nthis document without publishing such updates.\\nPublished on 30 Apr 2020\\nIntroduction\\nThe Government recognises that Agencies work extensively with Third \\nParties to deliver services to citizens, carry out operational functions, \\nand plan and analyse policies. When doing so, these Third Parties may \\nhandle large volumes of data from the Government. Hence, the high \\nstandards of data protection that the Government places on itself must \\nalso extend to these Third Parties.\\nWith this in mind, the Government has introduced policies to guide \\nAgencies in ensuring that Third Parties adequately safeguard data. \\nThese policies are organised based on the lifecycle of the relationship \\nbetween the Agency and the Third Party, namely: Evaluation and \\nSelection, Contracting and On-boarding, Service Management and \\nTransition Out (as shown in Diagram below). When working with Third \\nParties, Agencies will deﬁne the data security requirements that each \\nThird Party has to comply with based on the Government’s data \\nsecurity policies.\\n01\\nKey Policies of the Government’s Third-Party Management Framework    |\\nLifecycle of the Third-Party1\\nManagement Framework\\na  Data subject refers to the individual or entity to which the data relates.\\n \\nb  Agency refers to Organs of State, Ministries, Departments and Statutory Boards.\\n  DEFINITION\\n1 Third Party is deﬁned as a party (other than a data subjecta \\nor an Agencyb) which:\\n(i) delivers, develops, implements, operates, provides or otherwise supplies \\nICT systems or services to an Agency, or\\n(ii) collects, stores or otherwise processes data for an Agency.\\nThird-Party\\nManagement\\nFramework\\n01  Evaluation and Selection\\n02  Contracting\\n         and On-boarding\\n04\\n  Transition\\n        Out\\n03  Service Management\\n02\\nKey Policies of the Government’s Third-Party Management Framework    |\\n01    To ensure that the Government \\nadequately manages its security, data \\nand project risks when engaging Third \\nParties, Agencies shall identify, assess, \\nprioritise and mitigate the risks when \\noutsourcing work to Third Parties during \\nthe evaluation and selection process.\\n02    To ensure that the security, data and \\nproject risks involved in assigning work \\nto Third Parties are addressed, \\nAgencies shall establish contracts or \\nother equivalent instruments with their \\nThird Parties to govern how the Third \\nParties should perform the assigned \\nwork in a manner that addresses all \\nidentiﬁed risks involved.\\n03    To ensure that the appointed Third \\nParties (and their personnel) are \\nadequately assessed, cleared and \\nprepared for the assigned work, \\nAgencies shall implement an \\non-boarding process which includes \\nbrieﬁngs on applicable data security \\nrequirements, security clearance and \\nobtaining undertakings from Third-Party \\npersonnel, where necessary.\\nKey Policies of the Third-Party \\nManagement Framework\\nStage 1\\nEvaluation\\nand Selection\\nStage 2 \\nContracting\\nand\\nOn-boarding\\n03\\nKey Policies of the Government’s Third-Party Management Framework    |\\n04    Agencies shall regularly monitor and \\nreview the Third Parties’ performance \\nand compliance with applicable \\npublic sector policies and standards \\nwhich are incorporated in the \\ncontracts or equivalent instruments \\nestablished with the Third Parties.\\n05    Agencies shall perform regular \\nchecks or audits on their Third Parties \\nthroughout the period of \\nengagement to ensure that the Third \\nParties carry out their assigned work in \\ncompliance with contractual \\nobligations and applicable public \\nsector policies and standards.

    "\n",
    "So we 100% need to keep below this. If we assume a very safe margin of ~2000 tokens for the input prompt into `gpt-3.5-turbo`, leaving ~2000 tokens for conversation history and completion.\n",

    "To create these snippets we use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain. To measure the length of snippets we also need a *length function*. This is a function that consumes text, counts the number of tokens within the text (after tokenization using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` tokenizer), and returns that number. We define it like so:"
